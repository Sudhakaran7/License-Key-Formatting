You are given a license key represented as a string S which consists only alphanumeric character and dashes. The string is separated into N+1 groups by N dashes.
Given a number K, we would want to reformat the strings such that each group contains exactly K characters, except for the first group which could be shorter than K, 
but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups and all lowercase letters should be converted to uppercase.
Given a non-empty string S and a number K, format the string according to the rules described above.

Input Description:
A string S and a integer K as inputs.

Output Description:
Print the formatted string with S and K.

Sample Input:
5F3Z-2e-9-w 4

Sample Output:
5F3Z-2E9W

Explanation:

Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.
